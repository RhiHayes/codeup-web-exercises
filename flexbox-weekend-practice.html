<!--

   To start using flexbox to position items, you need to
   include "display: flex;" in the parent element in CSS. Then,
   the flex items will be allowed to move.

   -->


<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (DEFAULT/ flex-direction: row)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-df-1">
    <div class="flex-item-df-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-df-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-df-1">Item 3</div>
</div>


<h2>UL/LI FLEXBOX (DEFAULT/ flex-direction: row)</h2>

<ul class="flex-container-df-2">
    <li class="flex-list-item-df-1">Item 1.1</li>
    <li class="flex-list-item-df-1">Item 1.2</li>
    <li class="flex-list-item-df-1">Item 1.3</li>
</ul>

<!--

    These are two examples of how to properly apply flexbox
    to other elements. DIV and UL have the same properties,
    but they clearly look different. The UL flexbox has
    spacing while the DIV flexbox does not. I can only assume
    this is because the items are LI's.

    ***Flex-direction tells the items which way to be ordered.***

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (flex-direction: row-reverse)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-rev-1">
    <div class="flex-item-rev-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-rev-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-rev-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is row reversed items. The only difference between
    this and the default is the addition of "flex-direction:
    row-reverse;". Reversing the items did NOT work when
    flex-direction was put in the flex item class. This
    reverses the ORDER that the items are lined up in.

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (flex-direction: column)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-col-1">
    <div class="flex-item-col-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-col-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-col-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is column items. The items in the column are stretched
    to fit the space. The only difference between
    this and the default is the addition of "flex-direction:
    column;".

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (flex-direction: column-reverse)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-colrev-1">
    <div class="flex-item-colrev-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-colrev-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-colrev-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is column reversed items. The items in the column
    are stretched to fit the space. The only difference
    between this and the default is the addition of
    "flex-direction: column-reverse;". This reverses the ORDER
    that the items are lined up in.

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (DEFAULT/justify-content: flex-start)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-jus-1">
    <div class="flex-item-jus-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jus-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jus-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is the justified content items. The only difference between
    this and the default is the addition of "justify-content:
    flex-start;". Justifying the items did NOT work when
    justify-content was put in the flex item class. "Justify-content:
    flex start" looks just like the default flexbox, so justifying the
    content isn't necessary in this scenario.

    ***Justify content adjusts the MAIN AXIS direction the items go in.***

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (justify-content: flex-end)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-jusend-1">
    <div class="flex-item-jusend-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jusend-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jusend-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is justified content items. The only difference between
    this and the default is the addition of "justify-content:
    flex-end;". This pushed the items to the edge of the parent/flex
    container.

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (justify-content: center)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-juscen-1">
    <div class="flex-item-juscen-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-juscen-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-juscen-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is justified content items. The only difference between
    this and the default is the addition of "justify-content:
    center". This centered the items in the middle of the parent/flex
    container.

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (justify-content: space-between)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-jusbe-1">
    <div class="flex-item-jusbe-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jusbe-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jusbe-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is justified content items. The only difference between
    this and the default is the addition of "justify-content:
    space-between". This spaced out the items inside the
    parent/flex container. Notice that the first and third item are
    pushed to the end of the container, while the second item remains
    in the center. It's easy to get confused with "space-between",
    "space-around", and "space-evenly".

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (justify-content: space-around)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-jusar-1">
    <div class="flex-item-jusar-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jusar-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jusar-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is justified content items. The only difference between
    this and the default is the addition of "justify-content:
    space-around". This spaced out the items inside the
    parent/flex container. Notice that the first and third item are
    NOT pushed to the edge of the container and instead have space around
    them. Space-around gives each item EQUAL AMOUNT OF SPACE AROUND IT,
    despite the flex container.

    -->

<h2>DIV FLEXBOX (justify-content: space-evenly)</h2>

<div class="flex-container-jusev-1">
    <div class="flex-item-jusev-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jusev-1">Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item-jusev-1">Item 3</div>
</div>

<!--

    Here is justified content items. The only difference between
    this and the default is the addition of "justify-content:
    space-evenly". This spaced out the items inside the
    parent/flex container. Notice that the first and third item are
    NOT pushed to the edge of the container and instead have space around
    them. Also notice that "space-around" and "space-evenly" look similar,
    but are NOT the same.

    Space-between gives EQUAL AMOUNT OF SPACE AROUND ITEMS,
    **WHILE TAKING THE FLEX CONTAINER INTO ACCOUNT.**
