<dl>
    <dt>1. What IS anime?</dt>
    <dd>Anime is an English name for the style and art for animation by
        Japanese culture. It comes in all different kinds of genres.</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>2. Why do they all have huge eyes?</dt>
    <dd>The theory of big anime representing Asian ethnicity is wrong,
        and not all anime artists draw huge eye styles. Another theory
        is that the Japanese focus on expression and emotion, and eyes were
        the key factor to use in doing so. Honestly, no one is 100% sure why
        animes have a habit of doing this. However, Osama Tezuka, the creator
        of Astro Boy, was the first to use this style and other artists just
        followed.</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>3. Why are English words sometimes said in Japanese songs?</dt>
    <dd>Because English in Japan is considered “cool”, especially with the
        younger generation. There are alot of roots of English words borrowed
        in Japanese as well.</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>4. What do -Chan, -San, -Sama, and all the other words stuck onto the end of
        Japanese names mean?</dt>
    <dd>This is like saying “Mr.” and “Mrs.” in the English language. They are also based
        on the speaker’s rank in society. They are also usually not gender-oriented.</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>5. Who created anime, and when?</dt>
    <dd>The art form we now call "anime" doesn't have a specific birthdate,
        and it wasn't exactly created by anyone. But, partly as a result of being
        either the first or among the first to use the big-eyed style, Tezuka Osamu
        is generally considered the "father" of anime. He started creating comics in
        1947, which were extremely popular, and at the beginning of 1963 Tetsuwan
        Atomu (known outside Japan as Astro Boy) began airing. That is generally
        considered the first anime-style animated production.</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>6. What is the difference between anime and cartoons?</dt>
    <dd>In truth, there is a debate among the anime community as to the specific
        differences between anime and cartoons. Some of the key points people argue
        are the distinct differences between the art styles, the origin and influences
        of the animation, the targeted audience, and the cultural differences.
        Some even argue that the word “anime” is simply synonymous and interchangeable
        with the term “cartoon.”</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>7. Is anime just for kids?</dt>
    <dd>Nope! Anime is for everyone. Just as there are different genres for movies and
        books, so too are there different genres for anime. There are some anime that
        appear childish in a manner of either the art style, the voice acting or the
        story itself, and to some that might be more appealing than a dark and dramatic
        story, or a scary horror anime.</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>8. What is the difference between subbed and dubbed? Which should I watch?</dt>
    <dd>These terms refer to the audio used in an anime, specifically whether it is original audio
        (such as in Japanese) with subtitles in a language viewers can understand, or
        if it is dubbed meaning that there are voice actors using a different
        language other than the original audio to voice the characters of the show.
        As for which one you should watch, it’s a matter of opinion. If you prefer to
        watch something in the original audio with subtitles in the language you speak,
        then go for it! If you don’t like the hassle of trying to read and watch at the
        same time, then maybe watching in dubbed is a better choice for you? Or perhaps
        the anime you are watching is only available to watch in one language, whether
        that is dubbed or subbed? Either way it is a matter of opinion and choice.</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>9. You mention manga on occasion, what is it?</dt>
    <dd>Many anime are based on or adapted from popular manga. Manga are similar to
        comic books. Manga are usually read in a traditional format from right to left
        instead of the normal left to right, beginning in the top right hand corner and
        moving downwards. Manga is also generally in black and white, depending on the
        type or genre of Manga. Although sometimes manga can have featured colored
        pages.</dd>

    <br>

    <dt>10. What is an otaku?</dt>
    <dd>Otaku is a term used to refer to an individual, or a group of individuals,
        that enjoy anime and anime culture. Otaku, although it used to be used as a
        somewhat derogatory term, is now used more similarly to the usage of the words
        “dork,” “nerd,” and “geek,” and have less of a negative connotation.</dd>
