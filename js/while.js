/*---Do-While Loop---*/

/*An ice cream seller can't go home until she sells all of her cones.
First write enough code that generates a random number between 50 and 100
representing the amount of cones to sell before you start your loop. Inside of the
loop your code should generate another random number between 1 and 5, simulating the
amount of cones being bought by her clients. Use a do-while loop to log to the console
the amount of cones sold to each person.
